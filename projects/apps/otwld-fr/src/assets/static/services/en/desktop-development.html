<h2>Why we use Electron JS at Outworld</h2>
<p>
  Electron JS is a framework based on Node.js and Chromium that enables us to
  build desktop applications using standard web technologies like HTML, CSS and,
  of course, JavaScript. The desktop apps built with Electron JS can be easily
  packaged for Mac, Linux or Windows. See some of our Electron JS projects.
</p>

<h3>What is Electron</h3>

<p>
  Electron.js is a runtime framework that allows the user to create
  desktop-suite applications with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. It’s an open
  source project started by Cheng Zhao, an engineer at GitHub.
</p>

<h3>Electron benefits</h3>

<p>
  Even developers who don’t specialize in front-end web development have many
  good reasons to embrace Electron, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>security</li>
  <li>large community of developers & users</li>
  <li>cross-platform support</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Electron development makes the most sense when building multi-platform desktop
  applications that don’t need to adhere to strict memory usage requirements and
  emphasize UX and UI design.
</p>

<h3>Electron use cases</h3>

<p>
  Electron.js takes care of most of the dynamic applications which use our
  browser as a platform to deliver their embedded features and help us connect
  with a wider audience. After all, building and delivering the right
  applications that can help the users get their job done is the principal
  purpose of any open-source framework.
</p>

<h3>Electron real world examples</h3>

  Here are 5 popular Electron apps that you’ve most likely heard about at some

<h3>How much it costs</h3>

<p>
  We have worked on web app development projects with budgets that range from
  $10k to $1.5m. It’s very much dependent on the scope and duration of our
  involvement. Schedule a quick call with our Business Development Manager to
