<h3>What is Team Extension?</h3>

<p>
  It could be called team extension, IT staff augmentation, dedicated team, but
  in the end is an outsourcing strategy. This strategy is about evaluating
  skills of your current in-house team and adding to it the lacking skillset by
  hiring external remote team/experts.
</p>

<h3>Team extension vs growing a team in-house</h3>

<p>
  Staff augmentation is almost like having an in-house team with a difference
  that in most of the cases they are an offshore/nearshore team. In most of the
  cases, you will manage the work that the extension team is doing, but you
  don’t have to care about the hiring costs, paperwork, social benefits,
  training or even equipment.
</p>

<h3>How does Team Extension services compare to project outsourcing?</h3>

<p>
  In comparison to project outsourcing, staff augmentation gives you more
  project management control, cost control and less risk on a long term.
</p>

<h3>Why use Team Extension?</h3>

<p>
  If you cannot find great developers, want to scale your team fast and for a
  temporary period, cannot afford in-house developers locally or simply don't
  have time for building an in-house team, then IT staff augmentation is for
  you.
</p>

<h3>How much it costs?</h3>

<p>
  The budget for Team Extension projects is starting at 500€ per day. It’s very much dependent on the scope and duration of
  our involvement. Schedule a quick call with our Business Development Manager
