<h2>MesDocteurs</h2>

<h3>Mission context</h3>

<p>I joined MesDocteurs for a team reinforcement in November 2021. MesDocteurs offers a set of applications to perform online teleconsultation with doctors.</p>
<p>
  Throughout my mission at MesDocteurs, I was able to work with the product team as well as the design team to design a set of features ranging from video calling to payment management..
</p>

<p>
  In addition, although development was my main mission, I was naturally invested by my managers in team management.</p>

<p>
  â–º The challenge was to evolve a very large application while maintaining the legacy applications
