<h2>ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING</h2>

<h3>Mission background</h3>

<p>
  Innoval is the result of the merger of the Évolution cooperative, the GDS
  Bretagne and the BCEL Ouest and Copavenir livestock consulting companies,
  which together represent more than 30,000 breeders and 1,700 employees.
</p>

<p>
  At Advential I strengthened the team in charge of the client project
  "Innoval360" by replacing the Tech Lead who had just left. The team was
  composed of 4 frontend developers of which I was the Lead, and 2 backend
  developers led by another Lead. We worked in close collaboration between leads
  and the project manager, as well as with the various people at Innoval.

<p>
  ► The challenge was to create an application that is both static and nomadic,
  connected and offline, efficient and intuitive for the operators and
  administrators of the tools while aggregating the old data and use cases of
  the tools that the application replaces.
